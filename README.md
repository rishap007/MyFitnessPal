## 🎨 Features in Detail

### 🤖 AI Plan Generation

The app uses carefully crafted prompts to generate high-quality, personalized plans:

```typescript

const workoutPlan = await generateFitnessPlan({
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 28,
  fitnessGoal: "Muscle Gain",
  fitnessLevel: "Intermediate",
  workoutLocation: "Gym"
});

// Returns:
{
  workout: [
    {
      day: "Monday",
      name: "Upper Body Strength",
      exercises: [
        { name: "Bench Press", sets: "4 sets", reps: "8-10 reps", rest: "90s" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  meals: [...],
  tips: [...]
}
```

### 🔊 Voice Features

Text-to-speech powered by Web Speech API:

```typescript
// Click any speaker icon to activate
const { speak, pause, resume, stop } = useTextToSpeech();

```

**Benefits:**
