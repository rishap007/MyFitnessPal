You are an expert full-stack AI engineer specializing in Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn UI, TypeScript, OpenAI/Gemini/Claude APIs, ElevenLabs, and Replicate. Your task is to design, develop, and deploy a fully functional AI Fitness Coach Web App end-to-end. The app should collect user inputs like Name, Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Fitness Goal (Weight Loss, Muscle Gain, etc.), Fitness Level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), Workout Location (Home, Gym, Outdoor), Dietary Preference (Veg, Non-Veg, Vegan, Keto), and optional fields like Stress Level or Medical History. Based on this, the app should use an AI model (OpenAI/Gemini/Claude) to dynamically generate a personalized 7-day workout plan (with exercises, sets, reps, and rest time), diet plan (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks), and motivational tips. Include a voice assistant using ElevenLabs or OpenAI TTS to read out the workout and diet plans with options to choose sections. Implement AI image generation (Replicate or OpenAI Images) for exercises and meals that appear when clicked (e.g., “Barbell Squat” → exercise image, “Grilled Chicken Salad” → food image). Add features like Export as PDF (jsPDF or react-pdf), Dark/Light mode toggle, Save Plan (LocalStorage/Supabase), Regenerate Plan, Daily AI Motivational Quote, and smooth animations using Framer Motion or GSAP. Build with Next.js (App Router), Tailwind + Shadcn for UI, Zustand or Context API for state management, and deploy on Vercel. Use structured AI prompts like: “You are a certified AI fitness coach. Generate a personalized 7-day plan for {name}, {age} years old, {gender}, weight {weight}kg, height {height}cm. Goal: {goal}, Fitness Level: {level}, Workout Location: {location}, Diet Preference: {diet}. Include daily workout plan, meal plan, and motivation.” Parse the LLM output into structured JSON for display. Pages should include: 1) Landing Page (Hero, Features, CTA), 2) User Input Form Page, 3) Plan Generation Page with collapsible sections and motion effects, 4) Image and Voice Integration, and 5) Export/Extras page. Deliverables: fully functional deployed app, GitHub repo with clean commits and README (setup + API key guide), and demo video showing plan generation, voice, and image features. Optional: add authentication (Clerk/Supabase) and an AI chat coach section. Build the complete project autonomously from scratch, ensure a polished UI/UX, responsive design, and output the live app link, GitHub link, and video demo when done.
